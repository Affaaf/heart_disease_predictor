# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals using the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle. It involves several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying the logistic regression algorithm for classification. We will also calculate and evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for the model. Finally, we'll save the trained model and demonstrate how to predict heart disease based on symptoms.

## Dataset

- **Description**: This dataset contains various features related to health, and the target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease).

## Requirements

- Python (3 recommended)
- Required Python packages (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the code)

## Project Structure


## Steps to Reproduce


1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore and analyze the dataset by running the `heart_prediction_practice.ipynb` notebook.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data, including handling missing values.

4. **Model Training**: Use the `heart_prediction_practice.ipynb` notebook to train a logistic regression model on the preprocessed data.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score using the test data.

6. **Save Model**: Save the trained model to the `models/` directory as `heart.sav`.

7. **Predict Heart Disease**: Use the `heart_prediction_practice.ipynb` notebook to make predictions based on user input symptoms.

## Results
